Fiddler Bot UI
==============

UI for fiddler bot.

If you've never used Node or npm before, you'll need to install Node.
If you use homebrew, do:

```
brew install node
```

Otherwise, you can download and install from [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).

### Install npm dependencies
```
npm install
```

This runs through all dependencies listed in `package.json` and downloads them to a `node_modules` folder in your project directory.

### The `gulp` command
To run the version of gulp installed local to the project, in the root of your this project, you'd run

```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

**WAT.** Why can't I just run `gulp`? Well, you could install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp`, which will add the gulp script to your global bin folder, but it's always better to use the version that's specified in your project's package.json.  My solution to this is to simply alias `./node_modules/.bin/gulp` to `gulp`. Open up `~/.zshrc` or `~./bashrc` and add the following line:

```
alias gulp='node_modules/.bin/gulp'
```
Now, running `gulp` in the project directory will use the version specified and installed from the `package.json` file.
